## Application Layers

1. **Presentation Layer (Web Layer)**
   - **Description:** This layer is responsible for handling the user interface and user interactions. It contains the controllers and views.
   - **Technologies Used:** 
     - **Spring MVC:** Handles incoming HTTP requests and delegates them to the appropriate service methods.
     - **Thymeleaf:** A template engine for rendering dynamic web pages on the server side, enabling a clean separation of HTML content and Java logic.

2. **Service Layer**
   - **Description:** The service layer contains the business logic of the application. It acts as an intermediary between the controller and the repository layers, processing requests, applying business rules, and coordinating the flow of information.
   - **Technologies Used:**
     - **Spring Service Components:** Annotated with `@Service`, these components house the core logic and workflows of the application.

3. **Data Access Layer (Repository Layer)**
   - **Description:** This layer is responsible for interacting with the database. It contains repositories that abstract the underlying data storage and provide CRUD operations on domain entities.
   - **Technologies Used:**
     - **Spring Data JPA:** Provides an abstraction over JPA, allowing for easy interaction with the H2 database. Repositories are typically interfaces extending `JpaRepository`.

4. **Database Layer**
   - **Description:** The database layer is responsible for storing and retrieving data. The application uses an in-memory H2 database, which is ideal for development, testing, and small-scale applications.
   - **Technologies Used:**
     - **H2 Database:** An in-memory database that is lightweight, fast, and easily integrated with Spring Boot. The schema and data are usually defined in SQL scripts or automatically generated by JPA based on entity classes.

## Instructions
### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Java 11 or later
- Maven (Optional: Maven Wrapper is included in the project)
- Git (Optional: To clone the repository)
- IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA)

### Installation

1. Clone the Repository
   
   If you havenâ€™t already, clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ticketmanager
   ```

2. Build the Project

   If you have Maven installed:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

   If you prefer using the Maven Wrapper:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install  # On Unix-based systems
   mvnw.cmd clean install  # On Windows
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Run the Application

   You can start the Spring Boot application using Maven or the Maven Wrapper:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   Or using the Maven Wrapper:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run  # On Unix-based systems
   mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run  # On Windows
   ```

2. Access the Application

   Once the application is running, you can access it in your web browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Testing

To run the tests, use:
```bash
mvn test
```

Or with the Maven Wrapper:
```bash
./mvnw test  # On Unix-based systems
mvnw.cmd test  # On Windows
```
